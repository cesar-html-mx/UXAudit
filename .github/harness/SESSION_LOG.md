# Session Log

## Harness initialization

- Created the repository execution map, machine-readable state, six milestone plans, quality
  workflows, product specifications, reusable skills, and evidence templates.
- Active milestone set to M01.
- No product implementation has been claimed.

## M01 clean restart — 2026-07-29

- At the owner's request, restored the unpublished M01 branch to `4959dba` and removed generated
  dependencies, build output, and coverage from the discarded attempt.
- Verified Node.js `24.18.0` LTS, npm `11.16.0`, current registry versions, and the TypeScript
  7/TypeScript ESLint incompatibility before implementation.
- Completed M01-T01 with an exact-version npm/ESM/ES2024/strict-TypeScript scaffold, reviewed
  esbuild install-script approval, a committed lockfile, and passing Node.js 24 typecheck/build.
- Completed M01-T02 with the current compatible ESLint, TypeScript ESLint, Prettier, Vitest,
  coverage-v8, and Husky releases. Added a flat type-aware lint configuration, 90% coverage
  thresholds, strict peer enforcement, repository-wide formatting baseline, and a pre-commit hook
  that delegates to the shared verification gate.
- Verified T02 under Node.js `24.18.0`: format, lint, typecheck, one focused unit test, build,
  coverage, dependency-tree resolution, and install-script review all passed.
- Completed M01-T03 with Commander `15.0.0`, an injectable CLI adapter, application-level scan
  request contract, npm executable mapping, and a process-only entry point.
- Verified help/version output, application delegation, missing-argument exit 2, unexpected-error
  exit 3, built `scan .`, eight tests, and 100% measured unit coverage under Node.js `24.18.0`.
